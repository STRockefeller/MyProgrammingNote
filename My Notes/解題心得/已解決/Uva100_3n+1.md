## Question

100 The 3n + 1 problem
Problems in Computer Science are often classified as belonging to a certain class of problems (e.g.,
NP, Unsolvable, Recursive). In this problem you will be analyzing a property of an algorithm whose
classification is not known for all possible inputs.
Consider the following algorithm:
1. input n
2. print n
3. if n = 1 then STOP
4. if n is odd then n  􀀀 3n + 1
5. else n  􀀀 n/2
6. GOTO 2
Given the input 22, the following sequence of numbers will be printed
22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
It is conjectured that the algorithm above will terminate (when a 1 is printed) for any integral input
value. Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, it is unknown whether this conjecture is true. It has
been verified, however, for all integers n such that 0 < n < 1; 000; 000 (and, in fact, for many more
numbers than this.)
Given an input n, it is possible to determine the number of numbers printed before and including
the 1 is printed. For a given n this is called the cycle-length of n. In the example above, the cycle
length of 22 is 16.
For any two numbers i and j you are to determine the maximum cycle length over all numbers
between and including both i and j.
Input
The input will consist of a series of pairs of integers i and j, one pair of integers per line. All integers
will be less than 10,000 and greater than 0.
You should process all pairs of integers and for each pair determine the maximum cycle length over
all integers between and including i and j.
You can assume that no operation overflows a 32-bit integer.
Output
For each pair of input integers i and j you should output i, j, and the maximum cycle length for integers
between and including i and j. These three numbers should be separated by at least one space with all
three numbers on one line and with one line of output for each line of input. The integers i and j must
appear in the output in the same order in which they appeared in the input and should be followed by
the maximum cycle length (on the same line).
Sample Input
1 10
100 200
201 210
900 1000
Universidad de Valladolid OJ: 100 – The 3n + 1 problem 2/2
Sample Output
1 10 20
100 200 125
201 210 89
900 1000 174

## My Solution

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int maxCycleLength(int n)
{
    int times=1;
    while(1)
    {
        if(n==1)
            break;
        else if(n%2==0)
            n/=2;
        else
            n=n*3+1;
        times++;
    }
    return times;
}
int main()
{
    int maxNum,minNum;
    int length=0;
    cin>>minNum;
    cin>>maxNum;
    for(int i=minNum;i<=maxNum;i++)
    {
        if(maxCycleLength(i)>length)
            length=maxCycleLength(i);
    }

    cout<<minNum<<" "<<maxNum<<" "<<length;
    return 0;
}
```



簡單的題目，直觀的解法

現在(202009)的角度來看可以寫得再簡潔一點，大概像這樣

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int maxCycleLength(int num,int times)
{
    times++;
    num=num%2==0?num/2:num*3+1;
    return num==1?times:maxCycleLength(num,times);
}
int main()
{
    int maxNum,minNum;
    int length=0;
    cin>>minNum>>maxNum;
    for(int i=minNum;i<=maxNum;i++)
        length=maxCycleLength(i,1)>length?maxCycleLength(i,1):length;

    cout<<minNum<<" "<<maxNum<<" "<<length;
    return 0;
}
```

`maxCycleLength`這個方法一看就覺得很適合遞迴，並且現在看到當時寫的while(1)裡面放個簡單的break條件就覺得很多餘...



## Better Solutions

可能是因為這是基礎題型的緣故，google到的不少答案都是初學者所撰，參考價值較少，下面這個人寫的`while((scanf("%d %d",&a,&b)) == 2)`是我比較不熟悉的做法。

```C++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
/*
    *
    * Prosen Ghosh
    * American International University - Bangladesh (AIUB)
    *
*/
int main(){

    int a,b;
    while((scanf("%d %d",&a,&b)) == 2){
        int mx = 0;
        int x = (a>b)?a:b;
        int y = (a<b)?a:b;
        for(int i = y; i <= x; i++){
        int n = i,cnt = 1;
            while(n > 1){
                if(n%2)n = 3*n+1;
                else n/=2;
                cnt++;
            }
            if(cnt >= mx)mx = cnt;
        }
        cout << a << " " << b << " " << mx << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
