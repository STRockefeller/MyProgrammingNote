# CS50

## Review with Questions

1. 一個指向`int`的指標在64位元作業系統中占用多少空間(bytes)?[答案](#pointers)

2. 我們可以透過`%s`在`printf`列印出字串的原理。[答案](#string)

3. 參考以下程式碼

   ```C
   #include <cs50.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   int main(void)
   {
       char *s = get_string("s: ");
       char *t = get_string("t: ");
   
       if (s == t)
       {
           printf("Same\n");
       }
       else
       {
           printf("Different\n");
       }
   }
   ```

   如果兩次輸入都輸入一樣得字串會得到什麼結果?為什麼? [答案](#Compare and Copy)

### Hexadecimal

**略**

### Address

> - It turns out that, with the billions of bytes in memory, those bytes for the variable `n` starts at some location, which might look something like `0x12345678`.
>
> - In C, we can actually see the address with the `&` operator, which means “get the address of this variable”:
>
>   ```
>   #include <stdio.h>
>   
>  int main(void)
>   {
>      int n = 50;
>       printf("%p\n", &n);
>   }
>     ```
>   
>   - `%p` is the format code for an address.
>   - In the CS50 IDE, we see an address like `0x7ffd80792f7c`. The value of the address in itself is not useful, since it’s just some location in memory that the variable is stored in; instead, the important idea is that we can *use* this address later.
>   
> - The `*` operator, or the dereference operator, lets us “go to” the location that a pointer is pointing to.
> 
>- For example, we can print `*&n`, where we “go to” the address of `n`, and that will print out the value of `n`,`50`, since that’s the value at the address of `n`:
> 
>   ```
>  #include <stdio.h>
>   
>  int main(void)
>   {
>      int n = 50;
>       printf("%i\n", *&n);
>   }
>   ```

### Pointers

有個例子不錯，這邊節錄

> - We can use the `*` operator (in an unfortunately confusing way) to declare a variable that we want to be a pointer:
>
>   ```
>   #include <stdio.h>
>   
>  int main(void)
>   {
>     int n = 50;
>      int *p = &n;
>      printf("%p\n", p);
>     }
>   ```
>   
>   - Here, we use `int *p` to declare a variable, `p`, that has the type of `*`, a pointer, to a value of type `int`, an integer. Then, we can print its value (an address, something like `0x12345678`), or print the *value at* its location with `printf("%i\n", *p);`.
>   
> - In our computer’s memory, the variables will look like this:
> 
> - ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/notes/4/p.png)
>
> - * Since `p` is a variable itself, it’s somewhere in memory, and the value stored there is the address of `n`.
>  * Modern computer systems are “64-bit”, meaning that they use 64 bits to address memory, so a pointer will in reality be 8 bytes, twice as big as an integer of 4 bytes.

講述觀念:

1. 變數p的類型為指標
2. `int* p`代表p指向的內容型別為`int`
3. 因為p是變數，所以記憶體中也會分配一塊位置去紀錄P的內容。
4. 在64位元的系統中，指標占用8 bytes



### string

> ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/notes/4/s_value.png)

> In fact, the CS50 library defines a type that doesn’t exist in C, `string`, as `char *`, with `typedef char *string;`. The custom type, `string`, is defined as just a `char *` with `typedef`. So `string s = "HI!"` is the same as `char *s = "HI!";`. And we can use strings in C in the exact same way without the CS50 library, by using `char *`.

重點整理

1. 在C中表示字串使用`char* s`，就是個指向`char`的指標
2. 我們在`printf`ˋ中使用`%s`就是讓電腦從指標指向的位置開始往後print字元直到'\0'為止

### Pointer Arithmetic

講述了指標運算方法

> - **Pointer arithmetic** is mathematical operations on addresses with pointers.
>
> - We can print out each character in a string (using `char *` directly):
>
>   ```C
>   #include <stdio.h>
>   
>  int main(void)
>   {
>      char *s = "HI!";
>       printf("%c\n", s[0]);
>       printf("%c\n", s[1]);
>         printf("%c\n", s[2]);
>   }
>   ```
>   
> - But we can go to addresses directly:
> 
>   ```C
>   #include <stdio.h>
> 
>  int main(void)
>   {
>      char *s = "HI!";
>       printf("%c\n", *s);
>       printf("%c\n", *(s+1));
>         printf("%c\n", *(s+2));
>   }
>   ```
> 
>   - `*s` goes to the address stored in `s`, and `*(s+1)` goes to the location in memory with an address one byte higher, or the next character. `s[1]` is syntactic sugar for `*(s+1)`, equivalent in function but more human-friendly to read and write.
> 
> - We can even try to go to addresses in memory that we shouldn’t, like with `*(s+10000)`, and when we run our program, we’ll get a **segmentation fault**, or crash as a result of our program touching memory in a segment it shouldn’t have.

### Compare and Copy

文中提到以下程式就算輸入相同的字串也會回傳"Different"

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("s: ");
    char *t = get_string("t: ");

    if (s == t)
    {
        printf("Same\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Different\n");
    }
}
```

> - Even when our inputs are the same, we see “Different” printed.
> - Each “string” is a pointer, `char *`, to a different location in memory, where the first character of each string is stored. So even if the characters in the string are the same, this will always print “Different”.

原因在於比較的對象是**指標**，指標只存取**位置**而不是裡面的內容，所以就算內容相同但因兩個指標指向的位置不同所以並不相等

示意圖

> ![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/notes/4/s_t.png)

複製的範例

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("s: ");

    char *t = s;

    t[0] = toupper(t[0]);

    printf("s: %s\n", s);
    printf("t: %s\n", t);
}
```

`char *t = s;`讓指標t指向與指標s相同的位置，所以更改其值會令兩個指標都取出更改後的值，換句話說，這個範例並沒有實際完成複製的動作，如下範例才能做到複製

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("s: ");

    char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);
    if (t == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n + 1; i++)
    {
        t[i] = s[i];
    }

    if (strlen(t) > 0)
    {
        t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
    }

    printf("s: %s\n", s);
    printf("t: %s\n", t);

    free(t);
}
```

當然套用header就都是小問題

> We can actually also use the `strcpy` function, from the C’s string library, with `strcpy(t, s);` instead of our loop, to copy the string `s` into `t`.

### Valgrind

用來檢查memory leak的指令

> - `valgrind` is a command-line tool that we can use to run our program and see if it has any **memory leaks**, or memory we’ve allocated without freeing, which might eventually cause out computer to run out of memory.
>
> - Let’s build a string but allocate less than what we need in 
>
>   ```
>   memory.c
>   ```
>
>   :
>
>   ```
>   #include <stdio.h>
>   #include <stdlib.h>
>   
>   int main(void)
>   {
>       char *s = malloc(3);
>       s[0] = 'H';
>       s[1] = 'I';
>       s[2] = '!';
>       s[3] = '\0';
>       printf("%s\n", s);
>   }
>   ```
>
>   - We also don’t free the memory we’ve allocated.
>   - We’ll run `valgrind ./memory` after compiling, and we’ll see a lot of output, but we can run `help50 valgrind ./memory` to help explain some of those messages. For this program, we see snippets like “Invalid write of size 1”, “Invalid read of size 1”, and finally “3 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost”, with line numbers nearby. Indeed, we’re writing to memory, `s[3]`, which is not part of what we originally allocated for `s`. And when we print out `s`, we’re reading all the way to `s[3]` as well. And finally, `s` isn’t freed at the end of our program.
>
> - We can make sure to allocate the right number of bytes, and free memory at the end:
>
>   ```
>   #include <stdio.h>
>   #include <stdlib.h>
>     
>   int main(void)
>   {
>       char *s = malloc(4);
>       s[0] = 'H';
>       s[1] = 'I';
>       s[2] = '!';
>       s[3] = '\0';
>       printf("%s\n", s);
>       free(s);
>   }
>   ```
>
>   - Now, `valgrind` doesn’t show any warning messages.

### Garbage values

主要說明宣告沒有初值指標的危險性 **略**

### Swap

建一個function內容是交換兩個輸入的值，但在主程式調用時卻發現兩數並沒有被交換(因為function只有**傳值**進去，與外頭的變數是不一樣的東西)

### Memory Layout

![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/notes/4/memory_layout.png)

> - The **machine code** section is our compiled program’s binary code. When we run our program, that code is loaded into the “top” of memory.
> - Just below, or in the next part of memory, are **global variables** we declare in our program.
> - The **heap** section is an empty area from where `malloc` can get free memory for our program to use. As we call `malloc`, we start allocating memory from the top down.
> - The **stack** section is used by functions in our program as they are called, and grows upwards. For example, our `main` function is at the very bottom of the stack and has the local variables `x` and `y`. The `swap` function, when it’s called, has its own area of memory that’s on top of `main`’s, with the local variables `a`, `b`, and `tmp`:

> If we call `malloc` for too much memory, we will have a **heap overflow**, since we end up going past our heap. Or, if we call too many functions without returning from them, we will have a **stack overflow**, where our stack has too much memory allocated as well.

### Scanf

> - We can implement `get_int`  ourselves with a C library function,`scanf`  :
>
> 
>   ```C
>   #include <stdio.h>
>
>      int main(void)
>  {
>       int x;
>      printf("x: ");
>          scanf("%i", &x);
>      printf("x: %i\n", x);
>   }
>   ```
> 
>  - `scanf` takes a format, `%i`, so the input is “scanned” for that format. We also pass in the address in memory where we want that input to go. But `scanf` doesn’t have much error checking, so we might not get an integer.
> 
>- We can try to get a string the same way:
> 
>   ```C
>     #include <stdio.h>
>   
>   int main(void)
>   {
>       char *s;
>       printf("s: ");
>       scanf("%s", s);
>       printf("s: %s\n", s);
>   }
>  ```
> 
>  - But we haven’t actually allocated any memory for `s`, so we need to call `malloc` to allocate memory for characters for our string. We could also use `char s[4];` to declare an array of four characters. Then, `s` will be treated as a pointer to the first character in `scanf` and `printf`.
>   - Now, if the user types in a string of length 3 or less, our program will work safely. But if the user types in a longer string, `scanf` might be trying to write past the end of our array into unknown memory, causing our program to crash.
>  - `get_string` from the CS50 library continuously allocates more memory as `scanf` reads in more characters, so it doesn’t have that issue.

### Files

打開外部文件的範例

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    FILE *file = fopen("phonebook.csv", "a");
    if (file == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }

    char *name = get_string("Name: ");
    char *number = get_string("Number: ");

    fprintf(file, "%s,%s\n", name, number);

    fclose(file);
}
```

### Graphics

> - We can read in binary and map them to pixels and colors, to display images and videos. With a finite number of bits in an image file, though, we can only zoom in so far before we start seeing individual pixels.
>
>   - With artificial intelligence and machine learning, however, we can use algorithms that can generate additional details that weren’t there before, by guessing based on other data.
>
> - Let’s look at a program that opens a file and tells us if it’s a JPEG file, an image file in a particular format:
>
>   ```C
>   #include <stdint.h>
>   #include <stdio.h>
>   
>   typedef uint8_t BYTE;
>   
>   int main(int argc, char *argv[])

>       if (!file)
>       {
>           return 1;
>       }
>   
>       // Read first three bytes
>       BYTE bytes[3];
>       fread(bytes, sizeof(BYTE), 3, file);
>   
>       // Check first three bytes
>       if (bytes[0] == 0xff && bytes[1] == 0xd8 && bytes[2] == 0xff)

>
>   - First, we define a `BYTE` as 8 bits, so we can refer to a byte as a type more easily in C.
>   - Then, we try to open a file (checking that we indeed get a non-NULL file back), and read the first three bytes from the file with `fread`, into a buffer called `bytes`.
>   - We can compare the first three bytes (in hexadecimal) to the three bytes required to begin a JPEG file. If they’re the same, then our file is likely to be a JPEG file (though, other types of files may still begin with those bytes). But if they’re not the same, we know it’s definitely not a JPEG file.
