[Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/)

偶然間發現的開放式課程

註2017以後有Python；2016以前有PHP

這邊記錄筆記及作業撰寫(如果有的話)

比較簡單的內容略過不記

---

## Lecture 0(2020)

### Binary

提到電腦所讀的數值都是由digit 0 以及 1 組成的

字元透過ASCII、圖像透過RGB等方式由數值表達

### Algorithms

舉兩個例子說明我們是如何找到解決問題的固定流程

### Scratch

推薦由Scratch開始接觸Programming並做了一些示範

---

## Lecture 1(2020)

### C

開始介紹真正的programming language C

>  trying to absorb all these new concepts may feel like drinking from a fire hos

這段比喻挺生動的

提到寫程式時須考慮的三項品質指標


> When writing code, we might consider the following qualities:
>
> - **Correctness**, or whether our code works correctly, as intended.
> - **Design**, or a subjective measure of how well-written our code is, based on how efficient it is and how elegant or logically readable it is, without unnecessary repetition.
> - **Style**, or how aesthetically formatted our code is, in terms of consistent indentation and other placement of symbols. Differences in style don’t affect the correctness or meaning of our code, but affect how readable it is visually.

### CS50IDE

[**CS50 IDE**](https://ide.cs50.io/)

課程專用的線上IDE，點進去要求登入`github`並授權

最後寫了一個`Hello World程式`，並另存為`Hello.c`

### Compiling

編譯說明，直接貼原文

> - In the terminal in the bottom pane of our IDE, we’ll **compile** our code before we can run it. Computers only understand binary, which is also used to represent instructions like printing something to the screen. Our **source code** has been written in characters we can read, but it needs to be compiled: converted to **machine code**, patterns of zeros and ones that our computer can directly understand.
> - A program called a **compiler** will take source code as input and produce machine code as output. In the CS50 IDE, we have access to a compiler already, through a command called **make**. In our terminal, we’ll type in `make hello`, which will automatically find our `hello.c` file with our source code, and compile it into a program called `hello`. There will be some output, but no error messages in yellow or red, so our program compiled successfully.
> - To run our program, we’ll type in another command, `./hello`, which looks in the current folder, `.`, for a program called `hello`, and runs it.
> - The `$` in the terminal is an indicator of where the prompt is, or where we can type in more commands.

照著試了一下，結果如下圖

名為`Hello`的文件是在`make Hello`指令之後自動生成的(打開都亂碼)

### Functions and Arguments

對C的function做了基本的介紹，另外提了一些C語言的語法

以下節錄，對於function output 的解說，第一次知道原來那種輸出被稱作side effects

> Functions can also have two kinds of outputs:
>
> - **side effects**, such as something printed to the screen,
> - and **return values**, a value that is passed back to our program that we can use or store for later.
>   - The “ask” block in Scratch, for example, created an “answer” block.

接著是說明如何引用cs50的header並改寫程式

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");
    printf("hello, %s", answer);
}
```

感覺`cs50.h`好像很方便，不知道有沒有提供下載

### main, header files

不太重要，略過不提

### Tools

講解CS50 IDE的更多功能，以下原文

> - With all of the new syntax, it’s easy for us to make mistakes or forget something. We have a few tools written by the staff to help us.
>
> - We might forget to include a line of code, and when we try to compile our program, see a lot of lines of error messages that are hard to understand, since the compiler might have been designed for a more technical audience. **`help50`** is a command we can run to explain problems in our code in a more user-friendly way. We can run it by adding `help50` to the front of a command we’re trying, like `help50 make hello`, to get advice that might be more understandable.
>
> - It turns out that, in C, new lines and indentation generally don’t affect how our code runs. For example, we can change our `main` function to be one line, `int main(void){printf("hello, world");}`, but it’s much harder to read, so we would consider it to have bad style. We can run **`style50`**, as with `style50 hello.c`, with the name of the file of our source code, to see suggestions for new lines and indentation.
>
> - Additionally, we can add **comments**, notes in our source code for ourselves or other humans that don’t affect how our code runs. For example, we might add a line like `// Greet user`, with two slashes `//` to indicate that the line is a comment, and then write the purpose of our code or program to help us remember later on.
>
> - **`check50`** will check the correctness of our code with some automated tests. The staff writes tests specifically for some of the programs we’ll be writing in the course, and instructions for using `check50` will be included in each problem set or lab as needed. After we run `check50`, we’ll see some output telling us whether our code passed relevant tests.

>   The CS50 IDE also gives us the equivalent of our own computer in the cloud, somewhere on the internet, with our own files and folders. If we click the folder icon in the top left, we’ll see a file tree, a GUI of the files in our IDE:

>   - To open a file, we can just double-click it. `hello.c` is the source code that we just wrote, and `hello` itself will have lots of red dots, each of which are unprintable characters since they represent binary instructions for our computers.

### Command

介紹CS50IDE下方terminal的功能

> - Since the CS50 IDE is a virtual computer in the cloud, we can also run commands available in Linux, an operating system like macOS or Windows.
>
> - In the terminal, we can type in
>
>    
>
>   ```
>   ls
>   ```
>
>   , short for list, to see a list of files and folder in the current folder:
>
>   ```
>   ~/ $ ls
>   hello*  hello.c
>   ```
>
>   - `hello` is in green with an asterisk to indicate that we can run it as a program.
>
> - We can also *remove* files with `rm`, with a command like `rm hello`. It will prompt us for a confirmation, and we can respond with `y` or `n` for yes or no.
>
> - With `mv`, or *move*, we can rename files. With `mv hello.c goodbye.c`, we’ve renamed our `hello.c` file to be named `goodbye.c`.
>
> - With `mkdir`, or *make directory*, we can create folders, or directories. If we run `mkdir lecture`, we’ll see a folder called `lecture`, and we can move files into directories with a command like `mv hello.c lecture/`.
>
> - To *change directories* in our terminal, we can use `cd`, as with `cd lecture/`. Our prompt will change from `~/` to `~/lecturs/`, indicating that we’re in the `lecture` directory inside `~`. `~` stands for our home directory, or our account’s default, top-level folder.
>
> - We can also use `..` as shorthand for the parent, or containing folder. Within `~/lecture/`, we can run `mv hello.c ..` to move it back up to `~`, since it’s the parent folder of `lecture/`. `cd ..`, similarly, will change our terminal’s directory to the current one’s parent. A single dot, `.`, refers to the current directory, as in `./hello`.
>
> - Now that our `lecture/` folder is empty, we can remove it with `rmdir lecture/` as well.

### Types, format, and codes

一些基本的型別說明，比較特別的是CS50.h提供的內容

> 
> And the CS50 library has corresponding functions to get input of various types:
>
> - `get_char`
> - `get_double`
> - `get_float`
> - `get_int`
> - get_long
>   - `get_string`

### Memory, imprecision, and overflow

這個章節的概念雖然基礎，但我也忘得差不多了，正好趁機會複習

RAM

> Our computer has memory, in hardware chips called RAM, random-access memory. Our programs use that RAM to store data while they’re running, but that memory is finite.

Imprecision

> With `imprecision.c`, we can see what happens when we use floats:
>
> ```
> #include <cs50.h>
> #include <stdio.h>
> 
> int main(void)
> {
>     float x = get_float("x: ");
>     float y = get_float("y: ");
> 
>     printf("%.50f\n", x / y);
> }
> ```
>
> - With `%.50f`, we can specify the number of decimal places displayed.
>
> - 
>
>   Hmm, now we get …
>
>   ```
>   x: 1
>   y: 10
>   0.10000000149011611938476562500000000000000000000000
>   ```
>
> - It turns out that this is called **floating-point imprecision**, where we don’t have enough bits to store all possible values. With a finite number of bits for a `float`, we can’t represent all possible real numbers (of which there are an *infinite* number of), so the computer has to store the closest value it can. And this can lead to problems where even small differences in value add up, unless the programmer uses some other way to represent decimal values as accurately as needed.

## Quiz1

答案我用程式碼區塊表示

### Question 1

In lecture, we saw that in order to run a C program (e.g., hello.c), we first need to run the command make hello, and then run the command ./hello.
What does running make hello do?

```Ans
compile hello.c to computer readable format
```



What does running ./hello do?

```Ans
Execute hello.c
```



What might happen if you were to run ./hello without first running 
make hello?

```Ans
the terminal will return "bash: ./Hello.c: Permission denied"
```



### Question 2

In your own words, what does it mean for a function to have
(a) arguments?

(b) a return value?

(c) side effects?
For each of (a), (b), and (c), give one example.

```Ans
(a) the arguments are the initial conditions that the function need them to work successfully
(b) a return value represent a result the function return finally
(c) some effects occurs outside during the function running
```

### Question 3

Recall that, in lecture, we saw the following two blocks of code, both of which print the same output.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZdBVcCN.png)

These are really just the C equivalents of the following two blocks of Scratch code.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3Kxu4na.png)

(a) Why, in C, do we use two equals signs (==) when we write else if (x == y), whereas in Scratch we use just a single equals sign (=) in ![img](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qljcUDxLu3j3-VPmWZ5n_-33SlfHypn-49bgYR9ho0KFORcGBLFx5N-fF0QsDEFlS2KluMZvMMOkSwlCpTGKspO-KiiyudKLRVgVZooeINeuuzcxTSONyjreb9_WFdVy_g)?

```Ans
in C , "x = y" means "let the value of x equals the value of y" and "x == y" is a boolean expression which returns true while "the value of x equals the value of y"
```



(b) Why is Version 2 of the code, whether implemented in Scratch or in C, arguably better designed than Version 1?

```Ans
at the final step while x>y and x<y are false, the Version 1 code will aslo check the condition (x==y), the version 2 won't.
```
