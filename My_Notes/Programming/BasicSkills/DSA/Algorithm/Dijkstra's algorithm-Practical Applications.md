Dijkstra's algorithm has widespread applications in various fields, including:

- **Network Routing**: Used in IP routing to find the shortest path for data packets.
- **Geographical Mapping**: Helps in finding the shortest routes between physical locations.
- **Telecommunication**: Networks use it to manage the routing of calls through a switching network.
- **Robotics**: Used in pathfinding algorithms for autonomous robots navigating obstacles.
