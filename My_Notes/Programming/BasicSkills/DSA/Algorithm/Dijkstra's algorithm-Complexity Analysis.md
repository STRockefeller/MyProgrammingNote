The complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm depends on how the set Q is implemented:

1. **Using a simple array**:
   - Time Complexity: O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices.
   - This is because finding the vertex with the minimum distance from Q takes O(V) time and it's done for each of the V vertices.

2. **Using a binary heap**:
   - Time Complexity: O((V+E) log V), where E is the number of edges.
   - The use of a priority queue reduces the time of extracting the minimum distance vertex.

3. **Using a Fibonacci heap**:
   - Time Complexity: O(V log V + E), which improves performance for dense graphs.
