1. **A* Algorithm**: Extends Dijkstra's by using heuristics to improve the search speed.
2. **Bidirectional Dijkstra**: Runs two simultaneous searches from both the source and the target, which can significantly speed up the search in some cases.
3. **Time-Dependent Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Adjusts for routes where travel times change depending on the time of day.
