### Complexity Analysis

The time complexities for operations in a [[Binary Heap|binary heap]] are as follows:

- **Insertion:** O(log n), because the maximum height of the binary tree is log n.
- **Deletion of Max/Min:** O(log n), due to the need to restore the heap after the root has been removed.
- **Find Max/Min:** O(1), as the max/min element is always at the root of the heap.
