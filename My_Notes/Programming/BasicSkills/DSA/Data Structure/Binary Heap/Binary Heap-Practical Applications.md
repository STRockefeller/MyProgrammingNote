[[Binary Heap|Binary heaps]] are particularly useful in various applications such as:

- **[[Priority Queue (Heap)|Priority Queues]]:** Efficient data extraction based on priority.
- **Heap Sort:** An efficient sorting algorithm using the heap data structure.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Many algorithms, including Dijkstra’s and Prim’s, use binary heaps for efficiency in handling vertices and edges.
