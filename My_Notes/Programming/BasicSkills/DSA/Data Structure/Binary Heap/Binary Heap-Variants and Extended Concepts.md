- **D-ary Heap:** A generalization of the binary heap where each node has D children instead of 2, reducing the height of the tree and potentially optimizing certain operations.
- **Binomial Heap:** Supports quick merging of two heaps, used in advanced queue and graph algorithms.
- **Fibonacci Heap:** Offers better amortized time complexities for operations like decrease-key, which is crucial in network optimization algorithms.
