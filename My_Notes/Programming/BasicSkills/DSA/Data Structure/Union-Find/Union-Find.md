### Union-Find Algorithm: Summary and Details

#### Summary
The Union-Find algorithm, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU), is an efficient data structure designed to manage sets divided into disjoint subsets.
It is pivotal in graph theory for detecting and managing connected components, especially useful in scenarios like network connectivity and constructing minimum spanning trees, notably in Kruskal's algorithm.

The structure's primary functions, `find` and `union`, are enhanced by path compression and union by rank, ensuring high efficiency. 
These operations help maintain an optimal structure, facilitating almost constant time complexity for each operation, crucial for handling dynamic connectivity issues in computational systems.

#### Steps and Pseudocode

The core operations of Union-Find are implemented using two main functions: `find` and `union`.
