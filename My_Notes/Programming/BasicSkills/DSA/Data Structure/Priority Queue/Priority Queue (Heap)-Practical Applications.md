### Practical Applications

Priority queues are widely used in scenarios where managing tasks by priority is essential, including:
- **Operating Systems:** For scheduling tasks based on priority.
- **Simulation Systems:** To handle events in the order of occurrence.
- **Network Routers:** To manage packets based on priority levels.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Such as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, which uses priority queues to select the next vertex to process.
