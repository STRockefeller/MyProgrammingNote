### Variants and Extended Concepts

**[[Binary Heap]]:** A common implementation that offers efficient operations and is easy to understand.

**Fibonacci Heap:** An advanced variant with better amortized complexities, useful in network optimization and graph algorithms.

**Binomial Heap:** Useful for operations that involve merging two heaps, commonly used in queue management systems.
