Docker ([[Introduction to Docker]]) is an open-source platform that allows you to build, deploy, and run applications in a containerized environment. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to install and set up Docker on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Docker, make sure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Linux, Windows, or macOS
- CPU architecture: x86_64, armhf, arm64, s390x, ppc64le
- Memory: 2GB RAM
- Disk space: 20GB

## Installing Docker

To install Docker on your system, follow the steps below:

### Linux

4. Add the Docker repository:

   ```
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```

5. Update the package index again:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

6. Install Docker:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

7. Verify that Docker is installed correctly:
