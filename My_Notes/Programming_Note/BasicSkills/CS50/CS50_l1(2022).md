## Review with Questions

## C(origin)

* Today we’ll learn a new language, C: a programming language that has all the features of Scratch and more, but perhaps a little less friendly since it’s purely in text.

* By the end of the term, our goal is not to have learned a specific programming language, but how to program.

* The syntax, or rules around structure, punctuation, and symbols in code, will become familiar to us, even if we might not understand what everything does right away.

* With Scratch, we explored some ideas of programming, like:
  
  * functions
    * arguments, return values
  * conditionals
  * Boolean expressions
  * loops
  * variables
    …

* Today, we’ll translate some of those ideas to C, a computer language with new syntax and more precision, though fewer words to learn than a human language might include.

* As a first-year student, we might not have known all the information about our new campus right away, but instead learned what we needed to on a day-by-day basis. Here too, we’ll start with the most important details, and “wave our hands” at some of the other details we don’t need quite yet.

* When we evaluate the quality of our code, we might consider the following aspects:
  
  * correctness, or whether our code solves our problem correctly
  * design, or how well-written our code is, based on how efficient and readable it is
  * style, or how well-formatted our code is visually

* Our first program in C that simply prints “hello, world” to the screen looks like this:
  
  ```C
  #include <stdio.h>
  
  int main(void)
  {
      printf("hello, world\n");
  }
  ```

## C(note)

When we evaluate the quality of our code, we might consider the following aspects:

* **correctness**, or whether our code solves our problem correctly
* **design**, or how well-written our code is, based on how **efficient** and **readable** it is
* **style**, or how well-formatted our code is visually

## IDEs, compilers, interfaces(origin)

* In order to turn this code into a program that our computer can actually run, we need to first translate it to binary, or zeroes and ones.

* Tools called IDEs, integrated development environments, will include features for us to write, translate, and run our code.

* One popular IDE, Visual Studio Code, contains a text editor, or area where we can write our code in plain text and save it to a file:

* Now our source code, or code that we can read and write, is saved to a file called hello.c. Next, we need to convert it to machine code, or zeroes and ones that represent instructions that tell our computer to perform low-level operations.

* A compiler is a program that can convert one language to another, such as source code to machine code:
  ![image](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/1/compiler.png)

* Visual Studio Code, also referred to as VS Code, is typically a program that we can download to our own Mac or PC. But since we all have different systems, it’s easier to get started with a cloud-based version of VS Code that we can access with just a browser.
  
  * In [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/), we’ll learn how to access our own instance of VS Code.

* In the bottom half of the VS Code interface, we see a terminal, a window into which we can type and run text commands:
  ![image](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/1/terminal.png)
  
  * This terminal will be connected to our own virtual server, with its own operating system, set of files, and other installed programs that we access through the browser.

* The terminal provides a command-line interface, or CLI, and it allows us to access the virtual server’s operating system, Linux.

* We’ll run a command to compile our program, make hello. Nothing appears to happen, but we’ll now have another file that’s just called hello, which we can run with ./hello:
  ![image](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/1/hello_world.png)

* We’ll open the sidebar and see that there are two files in our virtual server, one called hello.c (which we have open in our editor), and one called hello:
  
  ![image](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/1/sidebar.png)
  
  * The `make hello` command created the `hello` file containing machine code.
  
  * The sidebar is a graphical user interface, or GUI, with which we can interact visually as we typically do.

* To delete a file, for example, we can right-click it in the sidebar and select the “Delete Permanently” option, but we can also use the terminal with the `rm` command:
  
  ![image](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/1/rm.png)
  
  * We run `rm hello` to remove the file called `hello`, and respond `y` for “yes” to confirm when prompted.

* We can also run the `ls` command to *list* files in our current folder. We’ll compile our file again and run `ls` to see that a file called `hello` was created:
  
  ![image](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/1/make_hello.png)
  
  * `   hello` is in green with an asterisk, `*`, to indicate that it’s executable, or that we can run it.

* Now, if we change our source code to read a different message, and run our program with `./hello`, we won’t see the changes we made. We need to compile our code again, in order to create a new version of `hello` with machine code that we can run and see our changes in.
  
  * `make` is actually a program that finds and uses a compiler to create programs from our source code, and automatically names our program based on the name of the source code’s file.
