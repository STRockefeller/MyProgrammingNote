### Python Basics

透過C學現在進入完一些基礎的DSA後，現在進入新的程式語言Python。

不同於C，Python是我幾乎沒什麼接觸過的語言，所以筆記會記得詳細點。

> Source code in Python looks a lot simpler than C. In fact, to print “hello, world”, all we need to write is:
>
> ```
> print("hello, world")
> ```
>
> - Notice that, unlike in C, we don’t need to specify a newline in the `print` function or use a semicolon to end our line.
> - To write and run this program, we’ll use the CS50 IDE, save a new file as `hello.py` with just the line above, and run the command `python hello.py`.

照做試試

重點

* 行結尾不用`;`區隔(加了`;`也可以)，取而代之的是換行符號區隔了程式碼

> - We can get strings from a user:
>
>   ```
>   answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
>   print("hello, " + answer)
>   ```
>
>   - We also need to import the Python version of the CS50 library, `cs50`, for just the function `get_string`, so our code will look like this:
>
>     ```python
>     from cs50 import get_string
>     
>    answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
>     print("hello, " + answer)
>    ```
>     
>   - We create a variable called `answer` without specifying the type, and we can combine, or concatenate, two strings with the `+` operator before we pass it into `print`.

重點

1. import 的用法 `from cs50 import get_string`
2. 變數不用宣告可以直接賦值 `answer = get_string("What's your name? ")`

> We can use the syntax for **format strings**, `f"..."`, to plug in variables. For example, we could have written `print(f"hello, {answer}")` to plug in the value of `answer` into our string by surrounding it with curly braces.

```python
print(f"hello, {answer}")
```

很明顯，在C#對應

```C#
Console.Write($"hello, {answer}");
```

看例子不確定是不是只能在print使用這種作法，實驗看看

```python
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = f"{str1}, Rockefeller"

print (str2)
```

結果

> ~/ $ python Hello.py
> Hello, Rockefeller

看來這種方法適用於任何字串組合的情況



> Conditions look like:
>
> ```
> if x < y:
>     print("x is less than y")
> elif x > y:
>     print("x is greater than y")
> else:
>     print("x is equal to y")
> ```
>
> - Unlike in C, where curly braces are used to indicate blocks of code, the exact indentation of each line is what determines the level of nesting in Python.
> - And instead of `else if`, we just say `elif`.

條件式 重點

* 以縮排區分執行區塊
* else if 的寫法，python 寫成 `elif` (C/C++/C# `else if` 、Ruby `elsif`)
* 條件內容不用放在括弧裡面，最後要加`:`
* 邏輯運算子也長的不一樣 `and` `or` `not`



測試

```python
num1 = 1
num2 = 2
num3 = 3

if num2>num1 and num3>num2:
    print("haha")
    print("this line is also in block")
else:
    print("you cannot see this")
    print("you cannot see this,too")
    
print("outside")
```

結果

> ~/ $ python Hello.py
> haha
> this line is also in block
> outside



迴圈

> - Boolean expressions are slightly different, too:
>
>   ```python
>   while True:
>       print("hello, world")
>   ```
>
>   - Both `True` and `False` are capitalized in Python.
>
> - We can write a loop with a variable:
>
>   ```python
>   i = 0
>   while i < 3:
>       print("hello, world")
>       i += 1
>   ```
>
> - We can also use a `for` loop, where we can do something for each value in a list:
>
>   ```python
>   for i in [0, 1, 2]:
>       print("cough")
>  ```
>   
>  - Lists in Python, `[0, 1, 2]`, are like arrays in C.
>   - This `for` loop will set the variable `i` to the first element, `0`, run, then to the second element, `1`, run, and so on.
>   - And we can use a special function, `range`, to get some number of values, as in `for i in range(3):`. `range(3)` will give us a list up to but not including 3, with the values `0`, `1`, and `2`, that we can then use. `range()` takes other options as well, so we can have lists that start at different values and have different increments between values. By looking at the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=range#range), for example, we can use `range(0, 101, 2)` to get a range from `0` to `100` (since the second value is exclusive), incrementing by `2` at a time.
>   - To print out `i`, too, we can just write `print(i)`.
>   - Since there are often multiple ways to write the same code in Python, the most commonly used and accepted ways are called **Pythonic**.

比較特別的是最後for迴圈的一些用法，試試看

```python
numArr = [1,2,3,4,5]

for i in numArr:
    print(i)

for i in range(20):
    print(i)

for i in range(100,201,2):
    print(i)
```

結果

> 從1到5
>
> 從0到19
>
> 從100到200相隔2



型別

> - In Python, there are many built-in data types:
>   - `bool`, `True` or `False`
>   - `float`, real numbers
>   - `int`, integers
>   - `str`, strings
> - While C is a **strongly typed** language, where we need to specify types, Python is **loosely typed**, where the type is implied by the values.
> - Other types in Python include:
>   - `range`, sequence of numbers
>   - `list`, sequence of mutable values, or values we can change
>     - And lists, even though they’re like arrays in C, can grow and shrink automatically in Python
>   - `tuple`, collection of ordered values like x- and y-coordinates, or longitude and latitude
>   - `dict`, dictionaries, collection of key/value pairs, like a hash table
>   - `set`, collection of unique values, or values without duplicates



其他cs50提供的方法

> - The CS50 library for Python includes:
>
>   - `get_float`
>   - `get_int`
>   - `get_string`
>
> - And we can import functions one at a time, or all together:
>
>   ```
>   from cs50 import get_float
>   from cs50 import get_int
>   from cs50 import get_string
>   ```
>
>   ```
>   import cs50
>   ```
>
>   ```
>   from cs50 import get_float, get_int, get_string
>   ```

### Examples

重點整理

* 引用外部程式片段(跟前面差不多，略)

* 實現字典及其解說，直接貼原文

  > We can implement a dictionary with:
  >
  > ```python
  > words = set()
  > 
  > def load(dictionary):
  >   file = open(dictionary, "r")
  >   for line in file:
  >       words.add(line.rstrip())
  >   file.close()
  >   return True
  > 
  > def check(word):
  >     if word.lower() in words:
  >         return True
  >     else:
  >         return False
  > 
  > def size():
  >     return len(words)
  > 
  > def unload():
  >     return True
  > ```
  >
  > - First, we create a new set called `words`.
  > - Notice that we haven’t needed a `main` function. Our Python program will run from top to bottom. Here, we want to define a function, so we use `def load()`. `load` will take a parameter, `dictionary`, and its return value is implied. We open the file with `open`, and iterate over the lines in the file with just `for line in file:`. Then, we remove the newline at the end of `line`, and add it to our set `words`. Notice that `line` is a string, but has a `.rstrip` function we can call.
  > - Then, for `check`, we can just ask `if word.lower() in words`. For `size`, we can use `len` to count the number of elements in our set, and finally, for `unload`, we don’t have to do anything, since Python manages memory for us.

* 後面是說明一些Python與C不同的部分比如執行效率較差、直譯式語言的執行方法。

### Input, Conditions

> - We can get input from the user with the `input` function:
>
>   ```python
>   answer = input("What's your name? ")
>   print(f"hello, {answer}")
>   ```

要求輸入兩筆整數值並回傳和的範例

> - We can ask the user for two integers and add them:
>
>   ```python
>   from cs50 import get_int
>   
>   # Prompt user for x
>   x = get_int("x: ")
>   
>   # Prompt user for y
>   y = get_int("y: ")
>   
>   # Perform addition
>   print(x + y)
>   ```
>
>   - Comments start with `#` instead of `//`.
>
> - If we call input ourselves, we get back strings for our values:
>
>   ```python
>   # Prompt user for x
>   x = input("x: ")
>   
>   # Prompt user for y
>   y = input("y: ")
>   
>   # Perform addition
>   print(x + y)
>   ```
>
> - So we need to cast, or convert, each value from `input` into an `int` before we store it:
>
>   ```python
>   # Prompt user for x
>   x = int(input("x: "))
>     
>   # Prompt user for y
>   y = int(input("y: "))
>     
>   # Perform addition
>   print(x + y)
>   ```
>
>   - But if the user didn’t type in a number, we’ll need to do even more error-checking or our program will crash. So we’ll generally want to use a commonly used library to solve problems like this.



Namespace的用法，基本和C#相同

> - And we can demonstrate conditions:
>
>   ```python
>   from cs50 import get_int
>   
>   x = get_int("x: ")
>   y = get_int("y: ")
>   
>   if x < y:
>       print("x is less than y")
>   elif x > y:
>       print("x is greater than y")
>   else:
>       print("x is equal to y")
>   ```
>
> - 
>
>   We can import entire libraries, and use functions inside them as if they were a struct:
>
>   ```python
>   import cs50
>     
>   x = cs50.get_int("x: ")
>   y = cs50.get_int("y: ")
>   ```
>
>   - If our program needed to import two different libraries, each with a `get_int` function, for example, we would need to use this method to **namespace** functions, keeping their names in different spaces to prevent them fromm colliding.



python 沒有字元型別 使用字串代替

> To compare strings, we can say:
>
> ```
> from cs50 import get_string
> 
> s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
> 
> if s == "Y" or s == "y":
>     print("Agreed.")
> elif s == "N" or s == "n":
>     print("Not agreed.")
> ```
>
> - Python doesn’t have chars, so we check `Y` and other letters as strings. We can also compare strings directly with `==`. Finally, in our Boolean expressions we use `or` and `and` instead of symbols.
> - We can also say `if s.lower() in ["y", "yes"]:` to check if our string is in a list, after converting it to lowercase first.

### Mario

基本就是介紹關於`print()`更多的特性

> - We can print out a row of question marks on the screen:
>
>   ```python
>   for i in range(4):
>       print("?", end="")
>   print()
>   ```
>
>   - When we print each block, we don’t want the automatic new line, so we can pass a **named argument**, also known as keyword argument, to the `print` function, which specifies the value for a specific parameter. So far, we’ve only seen **positional arguments**, where parameters are set based on their position in the function call.
>   - Here, we say `end=""` to specify that nothing should be printed at the end of our string. `end` is also an **optional argument**, one we don’t need to pass in, with a default value of `\n`, which is why `print` usually adds a new line for us.
>   - Finally, after we print our row with the loop, we can call `print` with no other arguments to get a new line.
>
> - We can also “multiply” a string and print that directly with: `print("?" * 4)`.
>
> - We can implement nested loops:
>
>   ```python
>   for i in range(3):
>       for j in range(3):
>           print("#", end="")
>       print()
>   ```

重點整理:

* `print()`兩個引數的多載: `print("輸入的內容", end="結尾的內容")`
  * 當沒有指定end值的情況下其預設為換行`\n`，所以可以用`print()`來輸出空白行
  * 呈上，若不想換行的話可以指定`end=""`



### Overflow, imprecision

試試overflow，使用範例程式

```python
i = 1
while True:
    print(i)
    i *= 2
```

測試結果是不斷的列印出數字約一分鐘也沒有停下，最後被我強制關閉了

結論是在python中似乎不存在overflow的概念

在python中並不像C/C++等會先給定變數固定的記憶體空間

而浮點數同理，python會動態的分配空間

以下原文

> We see larger and larger numbers being printed, since Python automatically uses more and more memory to store numbers for us, unlike C where integers are fixed to a certain number of bytes.
>
> Floating-point imprecision, too, still exists, but can be prevented by libraries that can represent decimal numbers with as many bits as are needed.



### List, strings



重提一遍，python 並沒有 `Array`型別，取而代之的是`List`

不多說，看範例

> ```python
> scores = [72, 73, 33]
> 
> print("Average: " + str(sum(scores) / len(scores)))
> ```

`sum()`和`len()`兩個方法就字面上的意思BJ4



加入新物件的做法:`list.append(obj)`

> ```python
> from cs50 import get_int
> 
> scores = []
> for i in range(3):
>     scores.append(get_int("Score: "))
> ...
> ```



輸入轉uppercase範例，注意for loop歷遍的寫法(類似`foreach`)

```python
from cs50 import get_string

s = get_string("Before:  ")
print("After: ", end="")
for c in s:
    print(c.upper(), end="")
print()
```

比較C#

```C#
string s = Console.Readline();
foreach(char c in s)
    Console.Write(Char.ToUpper(c));
Console.Write('\n');
```



### Command-line arguments, exit codes

在CS50 Lecture2的時候，我們也有用過C來操作Command-line arguments

```C
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
    if (argc == 2)
    {
        printf("hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }
}
```

下面來看看python的版本



範例程式

```python
from sys import argv

if len(argv) == 2:
    print(f"hello, {argv[1]}")
else:
    print("hello, world")
```

測試

> ~/ $ python Hello.py
> hello, world
> ~/ $ python Hello.py Rockefeller
> hello, Rockefeller
> ~/ $ python Hello.py Rockefeller Street
> hello, world



抓全部`argv`範例

```python
from sys import argv

for arg in argv:
    print(arg)
```

測試

> ~/ $ python Hello.py Rockefeller Street
> Hello.py
> Rockefeller
> Street



exit code 範例

```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("missing command-line argument")
    sys.exit(1)
print(f"hello, {sys.argv[1]}")
sys.exit(0)
```

測試

> ~/ $ python Hello.py Rockefeller Street
> missing command-line argument
> ~/ $ python Hello.py Rockefeller
> hello, Rockefeller
> ~/ $ python Hello.py
> missing command-line argument



### Algorithms

linear search

```python
import sys

numbers = [4, 6, 8, 2, 7, 5, 0]

if 0 in numbers:
    print("Found")
    sys.exit(0)

print("Not found")
sys.exit(1)
```

```python
names = ["Bill", "Charlie", "Fred", "George", "Ginny", "Percy", "Ron"]

if "Ron" in names:
    print("Found")
else:
    print("Not found")
```



Dictionary

```python
from cs50 import get_string

people = {
    "Brian": "+1-617-495-1000",
    "David": "+1-949-468-2750"
}

name = get_string("Name: ")
if name in people:
    print(f"Number: {people[name]}")
```

> - We first declare a dictionary, `people`, where the keys are strings of each name we want to store, and the value we want to associate with each key is a string of a corresponding phone number.
> - Then, we use `if name in people:` to search the keys of our dictionary for a `name`. If the key exists, then we can get the value with the bracket notation, `people[name]`, much like indexing into an array with C, except here we use a string instead of an integer.
> - Dictionaries, as well as sets, are typically implemented in Python with a data structure like a hash table, so we can have close to constant time lookup. Again, we have the tradeoff of having less control over exactly what happens under the hood, like being able to choose a hash function, with the benefit of having to do less work ourselves.



Swap

```python
x = 1
y = 2

print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
x, y = y, x
print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
```

寫法比較特別，但也很直覺



### Files

範例

```python
import csv

from cs50 import get_string

file = open("phonebook.csv", "a")

name = get_string("Name: ")
number = get_string("Number: ")

writer = csv.writer(file)
writer.writerow([name, number])

file.close()
```

測試

> ~/ $ python Hello.py
> Name: Annie
> Number: 0999999999

可以看到新增了一個檔案`phonebook.csv`並且內容是

```csv
Annie,0999999999
```



另外的寫法，使用關鍵字`with`，就不會有忘記close的疑慮了

> We can use the `with` keyword, which will close the file for us after we’re finished:

```python
...
with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow((name, number))
```



## Quiz 6

> Question 1 of 3
>
>
> Recall that, in lecture, we saw an implementation of a spell checker in Python.
>
>
> 1. Why were we able to implement a spell checker in Python using fewer lines of code than it took to implement a spell checker in C?
> 2. Why did the spell checker in Python likely run slower than the spell checker you wrote in C?



SKIP



> Question 2 of 3
>
> Recall from lecture that, whereas C programs are compiled, Python programs are usually interpreted. In your own words, what does it mean for a programming language to be an interpreted language?



```Ans
like your boss make orders

In C language:
Boss:"fix the machine"
Boss:"make a manual"
Boss:"Prepare the meeting"
You:"Yes, sir"(fix the machine, make a manual, prepare the meeting)

In Python:
Boss:"fix the machine"
You:"Yes, sir"(fix the machine)
Boss:"make a manual"
You:"Yes, sir"(make a manual)
Boss:"Prepare the meeting"
You:"Yes, sir"(prepare the meeting)
```

```C
// declare an integer with name 'n'
int n;
/*
	Execute the function to get the input from users, save the value to 'n' and if the value is not in 1~8 do it again.
*/
do
{
    n = get_int("Height: ");
}
while (n < 1 || n > 8);
```

```python
# while true => infinity loop
while True:
    # a variable 'n' and its value is define by users as an integer
    n = get_int("Height: ")
    # if the value satisfied 1~8 break the loop
    if n >= 1 and n <= 8:
        break
```
