# Docker Images and Containers

#docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ([[Introduction to Docker]]) is a platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable environments that can be easily moved between machines and cloud platforms. In this markdown document, we will discuss Docker images and containers and their roles in the Docker ecosystem.

## Docker Images

Docker images are the building blocks of Docker containers. A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, including the code, libraries, and system tools. Docker images are created from Dockerfiles, which are declarative scripts that define the instructions to build the image.

Docker images can be built from scratch or based on other images. A Docker image can have multiple layers, each representing a change to the image. This layered approach enables efficient storage and sharing of images.

Docker images can be stored in a registry, such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), where they can be easily accessed and downloaded by users. Docker Hub is a central repository of Docker images, where developers can share their images and collaborate with others.

## Docker Containers

Docker containers are instances of Docker images that can be run on any machine that supports Docker. Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated from the host system and other containers running on the same machine. Each container has its own file system, network, and process space, which enables applications to run in a consistent environment regardless of the underlying system.

Docker containers can be managed using the Docker CLI or through Docker orchestration tools, such as [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). These tools enable developers to easily deploy and manage containers across multiple machines and cloud platforms.

## Conclusion

Docker images and containers are essential components of the Docker ecosystem. Docker images provide a portable and reproducible way to package and distribute applications, while Docker containers enable these applications to run consistently in different environments. With Docker, developers can easily build, deploy, and manage their applications, accelerating the development and delivery process.
