# About Circular Import

#dart #golang #c_sharp

## Abstract

When I was developing a flutter project, I found that I was able to do circuler imports in my project.

## Go

In Go, circular imports are not allowed. If two or more packages depend on each other, a compilation error will occur. The Go compiler uses a two-pass approach to compilation. During the first pass, it analyzes the package imports and creates a dependency graph. If there is a cycle in the graph, a compilation error is raised. This approach ensures that there are no circular dependencies in the final executable.

## Dart

In Dart, circular imports are allowed. When two or more libraries depend on each other, the Dart compiler uses a technique called "lazy loading" to handle circular dependencies. This means that the compiler delays the loading of a library until it is actually needed. When a library is loaded, the Dart VM checks if it has already been loaded and skips the loading process if it has.

While circular imports are allowed in Dart, it's still important to use them with care. Circular dependencies can lead to slower compilation times and make it harder to understand and maintain code.

## C\#

In C#, circular imports are allowed but can cause issues. If two or more namespaces depend on each other, a compilation error will occur. However, if two or more classes depend on each other, a circular reference can occur, leading to several issues such as infinite loops and runtime errors. To prevent this, C# allows developers to use forward declarations or interfaces to break the circular dependency.

## Comparison

| Language | Circular Import Handling |
| --- | --- |
| Dart | Allowed, lazy loading |
| Go | Not allowed, compilation error |
| C# | Allowed but can cause issues, use forward declarations or interfaces |

In summary, circular imports should be used with care in Dart and C#, and avoided altogether in Go. In Dart, circular dependencies are handled through lazy loading, while in C#, developers can use forward declarations or interfaces to break the circular dependency.
