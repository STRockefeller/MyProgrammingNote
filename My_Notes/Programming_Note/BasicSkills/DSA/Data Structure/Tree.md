## Abstract

> A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

> Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world.
>
> Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.

簡而言之，tree比起線性的資料結構在資料訪問的效率上來得更有效率。

名詞解釋:

* Node: tree上面每一個資料節點稱為Node，最上方的Node又稱為Root，沒有child nodes的node又稱為leaf
* Edge: 連結兩個Node的邊線
* Height of a Node: Root到最遠的Leaf經過的edges數量
* Depth of a Node: Root到指定Node經過的edges數量
