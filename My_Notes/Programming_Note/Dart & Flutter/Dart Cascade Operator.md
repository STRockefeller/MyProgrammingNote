# Dart Cascade Operator
#dart

In Dart, the cascade operator (`..`) is a shorthand syntax that allows you to perform a sequence of operations on the same object. It is also known as the cascade notation or the cascade pattern.

The `..` operator allows you to chain multiple method calls or property accesses on an object, without the need to repeat the object reference each time. Instead, you start the sequence with the object reference followed by the `..` operator and then chain the methods or properties you want to access one after another, separated by the `..` operator.

Here is an example that demonstrates the use of the cascade operator:

```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;
  
  void printInfo() {
    print('Name: $name, Age: $age');
  }
}

void main() {
  var person = Person()
    ..name = 'John'
    ..age = 30
    ..printInfo();
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `Person` class and use the cascade operator to set its `name` and `age` properties and then call its `printInfo()` method, all in one statement.

Note that the cascade operator returns the object being operated on, so you can continue to chain additional operations or assign the result to a variable.

```dart
var person = Person()
  ..name = 'John'
  ..age = 30;

var anotherPerson = person
  ..name = 'Jane'
  ..age = 25
  ..printInfo();
```

In this example, we first create a `person` object and set its `name` and `age` properties. Then, we assign this object to another variable `anotherPerson` and continue to set its `name` and `age` properties before finally calling its `printInfo()` method.
