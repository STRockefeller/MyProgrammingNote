# Vowel alternation in Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots tutorial

- Vowel alternation in PIE roots is also known as ablaut or apophony.
- It refers to the systematic variation of vowel quality and quantity in different forms of the same root.
- It is a common phenomenon in many Indo-European languages, such as English, Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, etc.
- It is often related to grammatical functions, such as tense, aspect, mood, number, case, etc.
- For example, in English, the verb sing has the forms sing, sang, sung, which show vowel alternation in the past tense and past participle.
- In PIE, there are five main grades of vowel alternation: e-grade, o-grade, zero-grade, lengthened e-grade and lengthened o-grade.
- The e-grade and o-grade are the full grades, where the root vowel is either e or o. For example, *bher- 'to carry' and *bhor- 'to bore'.
- The zero-grade is the reduced grade, where the root vowel is absent or reduced to a schwa. For example, *bhṛ- 'to carry' and *bhr̥- 'to bore'.
- The lengthened e-grade and o-grade are the extended grades, where the root vowel is either ē or ō. For example, *bhēr- 'to bear' and *bhōr- 'to bore through'.
- The distribution of these grades depends on various factors, such as accent placement, syllable structure, morphological environment, etc.
