1. **Capture Anything**: Jot down any thoughts, ideas, or pieces of information that come to mind, no matter how unstructured or disorganized. These are meant to capture your spontaneous thoughts.
2. **No Filtering**: Don’t worry about organizing these notes or how relevant they might seem at the moment.
3. **Short-Term Use**: Understand that fleeting notes are temporary. You’ll either discard them or refine them into more structured notes later.
