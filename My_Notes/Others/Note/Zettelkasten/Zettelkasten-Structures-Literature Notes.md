1. **Selective Notetaking**: As you read, jot down important concepts, insights, or quotes that stand out. Focus on information that is directly relevant to your research or interests.
2. **Use Your Own Words**: Try to paraphrase the information. This helps in processing the content and ensures you understand it fully.
3. **Include Context**: Alongside the notes, record bibliographic details like the source title, author, and page numbers. This is crucial for referencing and for revisiting the source if needed.
4. **Conciseness**: Keep the notes brief and to the point. This makes it easier to review and integrate them into your broader knowledge system later.
